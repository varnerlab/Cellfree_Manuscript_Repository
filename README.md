## Introduction
To compile the LaTeX source code, issue the command:

```
./Build.sh Paper_v1
```
at the command line. This assumes you have LaTeX installed on your machine. ``Build.sh`` is a shell script that compiles the document, and executes a call to ``BibTeX`` to incorporate the references (assumed to be in the ``References_v1.bib`` file). # Cellfree_Manuscript_Repository
